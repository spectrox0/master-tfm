# üìä Master TFM: Advanced Time Series Analysis Project üöÄ

Welcome to the Master TFM project! This project focuses on analyzing time series data using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models. With this analysis, we aim to extract valuable insights from complex datasets, specifically focusing on energy consumption trends and patterns. Our project covers a wide array of models, such as CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, and SARIMAX.

## üìë Dataset

The primary dataset we‚Äôre working with is the Open Power System Data. You can access the full dataset used in this analysis here. This dataset includes 60-minute interval time series data for power system usage across different regions.

The data is processed and analyzed using powerful Python libraries such as:

‚Ä¢ `pandas` for data manipulation
‚Ä¢ `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
‚Ä¢ `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for deep learning (CNN, LSTM)
‚Ä¢ `XGBoost` for gradient boosting models
‚Ä¢ `SARIMAX` for statistical time series forecasting
‚Ä¢ `numpy` for numerical computations
‚Ä¢ `matplotlib` and seaborn for data visualization

## üöÄ Objectives

‚Ä¢Implement multiple machine learning and deep learning models to analyze the time series dataset.
‚Ä¢ Explore patterns and trends in energy consumption.
‚Ä¢ Compare the performance of different models and optimize them for better accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

Follow the steps below to install and set up the project.

### Requirements

- `Python 3.11`
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
- `Make` (Makefile) for running project scripts

## Installation

### Installing Make

#### macOS

Make is typically pre-installed on macOS. If it's missing, you can install it via Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Alternatively, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install make
```

#### Linux

Most Linux distributions come with Make pre-installed. If it's missing, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

#### Windows

To use Make on Windows, you can install it via Chocolatey or use a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

Using Chocolatey:

Install Chocolatey if you haven't already: https://chocolatey.org/install

Install Make:

bash

```powershell
choco install make
```

Using WSL:

Install WSL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
Use the Linux instructions above once WSL is installed.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/master-tfm.git
   cd master-tfm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true && poetry shell
   ```

4. Generate the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files:

   ```bash
   make generate_requirements_with_poetry
   ```

### Using requirements-dev.txt

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/master-tfm.git
   cd master-tfm
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment in `.venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. Generate the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files:

   ```bash
   make generate_requirements
   ```

## Usage

After activating the virtual environment and installing all dependencies, you can start working on your project.

## Available Scripts

You can use the following commands to generate the `requirements.txt` files and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
make generate_requirements
```

## üìä Model Training and Data Analysis

To download the dataset and initialize the project for analysis:

You need to run the initialize.py script, which is set up to download data automatically. Depending on your environment, you can do it in several ways:

```bash
poetry run download-data
```

On Linux/macOS (using a shell script):

```bash
./initialize.py
```

On Windows:
With PowerShell:

```powershell
./initialize.ps1
```

```cmd
initialize.cmd
```

üéØ Conclusion

With this project, we aim to demonstrate the power of advanced machine learning and deep learning models applied to real-world time series data. From statistical models like SARIMAX to cutting-edge deep learning architectures such as CNN and LSTM, this project serves as a comprehensive toolkit for time series forecasting and analysis.
